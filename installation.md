### Installation Guide

There are two primary ways you might want to use the code in this repository.

(1) As an end user who simply wants to run the shiny app  
(2) As a developer who wants to adjust/customize the experience

We will detail each in turn.

#### End users

This functionality doesn't exist yet (sorry!), so you'll have to go the long way round and pretend you're a developer.

#### Developers

Make sure you have a working R install (we used version 4.1.2 although any 4.x.y version ought to work) with RStudio[^1], if this sounds scary try the documentation at the RStudio [website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

Now download this repository (either with `git clone' or by taking a zip). In RStudio navigate to the top level folder. Open UI.R and install the required dependencies if prompted (this can take a couple of minutes for a fresh install). Once that's all done the 'Run App' button should boot you into the app and editing/adjustments proceed as normal.

[^1]: Due to the size of this project (ie. small) the developers are unable to provide documentation for less mainline apporaches to working with R packages
